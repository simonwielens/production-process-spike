    <string name="eula">Movie Manager! This app is currently under active development, and I hope to add regular updates. If you have a suggestion please contact me or leave a comment!</string>
    <string name="updates">Welcome to the beta version of Movie Manager. Let me know if you find any bugs! Whats new in this version: Films plots, Special effects, pitch film changed, how to play instructions</string>

    <!-- How to play -->
    <string name="howtoplaytitle">How to play</string>
    <string name="howtoplaycontent">The goal of the game is to become Hollywood\'s biggest film producer and to get to the top of the all time box office. You start by creating your production company, and choosing which script you would like to make into a film. You can also create your own script if you have your own idea. You send the script out to producers to get some investment, and then hire a director, actors, and get your special effects.</string>
